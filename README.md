# 🎯 Predictive Modeling for Donation Optimization

This project was developed as part of my Master's in Business Analytics at Deakin University in collaboration with World Vision Australia. The objective was to predict donor contributions and optimize outreach efforts to improve donor engagement.

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

World Vision sought to improve the effectiveness of their donor campaigns by understanding key factors influencing donation amounts. The goal was to build predictive models that estimate `TotalPaid` (donation amount) based on supporter demographics, interactions, and engagement data.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Languages & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Techniques:**
  - Data cleaning, sampling & merging multi-source datasets
  - Feature engineering (e.g., age, campaign length, engagement duration)
  - One-hot encoding, missing value imputation
  - Model building: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting
  - Feature importance & selection
  - Visualization of model performance & correlations

---

## 🚀 Approach

✅ Integrated multiple datasets (`Responses`, `Demographics`, `Audiences`, `Contacted`, etc.) using `Deakin_SupporterID`.  
✅ Performed feature engineering: derived `Age`, `Campaign Length`, `Engagement Duration`, and interaction metrics.  
✅ Handled missing data and applied sampling for computational efficiency.  
✅ Built and evaluated multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Gradient Boosting Regressor
✅ Visualized predictions against actual values & analyzed feature importance.

## 📈 Results

- Best model (e.g., Random Forest) demonstrated strong predictive capability on test data.
- Identified top predictors of donation amount, providing actionable insights for targeting high-value donors.
- Delivered recommendations to World Vision team for campaign optimization.

## 📊 Visualizations

- Donation trends over time
- Product type & demographic distributions
- Correlation heatmaps
- Predicted vs. actual plots for each model

## 📝 Key Learnings

- Importance of feature engineering in improving predictive accuracy.
- Comparison of ensemble methods (Random Forest & Gradient Boosting) against simpler models.
- Handling real-world messy data with missing values and inconsistent formats.
